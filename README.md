# enumerable-methods

In this project, I recreated similar methods to those found in the Enumerable module, which would include the following:
* #each
* #each_with_index
* #select
* #all?
* #any?
* #none?
* #count
* #map
* #inject

Among the technical skills required for this project, I learned to:
* Run a file in IRB for testing
* Utilize the yield statement to pass a block into a method
* Pass parameters to a block also with yield
* Use loops to iterate through an array
* Handle multiple parameters
* Use the self statement to call the element that the method is processing
* Write a method that accepts procs
* Write a method that accepts a proc, block or both
* Use a combination of user guides and official Ruby documentation to learn more about default methods' behaviors
